# Shopping Cart = [Live Preview](https://robisonwebdev.github.io/shopping-cart/)

## Objective
My objective for creating a Shopping Cart with react was to learn how to use Router. Router allowed me move from creating single page applications, to multiple page applications. With Router I was able to setup a navigation using HashRouter, Switch, Route, and Link.
